Welcome to my GitHub repository dedicated to Operating Systems! Here you will find exercise solutions from my classes and a personal project showcasing my understanding and implementation of operating system concepts. The exercise solutions cover various topics such file descriptors, pipes, dups, process management, FIFO's and pipeline. Regarding the project, it consists in creating a server that recieves requests from various clients, retrieving information to the client if needed and storing the data about each request recieved in log files.
