Welcome to my GitHub repository dedicated to Operating Systems! Here you will find exercise solutions from my classes and a personal project showcasing my understanding and implementation of operating system concepts.

Regarding the project, it consists in creating a server that recieves requests from various clients, retrieving information to the client if needed and storing the data about each request recieved in log files.
